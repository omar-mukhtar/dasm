This work is provided under GPL. For details, see accompanying license file.

NOTE: The development work was done in Microsoft Windows 2000 environment, as all
of the SDK's for Symbian are available for that platform. 

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

	1. Nokia Communicator 9500 has a bug, which causes wrong UTC calculations.
	   Please download the patch from www.nokia.com and install it on 9500 machine.
	
	2. Bundle-Fragmentation is not fully supported. DASMv0.1 can reassemble fragments,
	   but cannot send fragmented bundles.
	
	3. Custody Transfer is not fully supported. Bundles are not stored in persistent storage.
	

BUILD for S80:
--------------

	1. Install S80 SDK. Get it from Forum Nokia website (www.forum.nokia.com).
	
	2. Also install PC Suite from the CD in phone accessories box.
	
	3. On command prompt, go to "AppAgent_ui_s80" folder.
	
	4. On command prompt, type the following commands to build installation 
	   file, "bpa.sis":
	
		bldmake clean
		bldmake bldfiles
		abld reallyclean
		abld build armi urel
		makesis bpa.pkg bpa.sis
	
BUILD S60:
----------

	S60 version still needs some fixes, and will be provided soon.

CONFIGURATION:
--------------

	1. Install bpa_s80.sis on Nokia 9500/9300(i) communicator using PC suite.
	
	2. Create the following folders manually:
	
		c:\data\dtn\config\
		c:\data\dtn\in\
		c:\data\dtn\out\
	
	3. Copy accompanying "routes.txt" and "bpa_config.txt" files (from BPA folder of package)
	   to the folder "c:\data\dtn\config\" on mobile phone. You can use PC suite utilities.
	
	4. Modify the files accordingly to configure a DTN node and routing
	   information.
	
	5. Create and configure an access point for WLAN (see device's User
	   Manual for details).


USAGE:
------

	1. Execute the application. This is a sample application to demonstrate
	   the functionality of BPA node. Other applications can be built using the
	   API.
	
	2. Execute menu command "BPA->Toggle Custody Acceptance Policy" to enable
	   this policy. This enables DTN accepting custody of bundles.
	
	3. From "CLA" menu, enable TCP-CLA if needed.
	
	4. From "CLA" menu, enable BT-CLA if needed. Remember to switch-off Bluetooth
	   manually before enabling CLA, and switching it on back after enabling
	   BT-CLA.
	
	5. Enable Log display from "Log" menu.
	
	6. Use "Send File" to send a file to a particular DTN node. This file will be
	   sent with an additional mail header prepended and can be received using
	   "dtnrecv" utility of Berkeley reference implementation, DTN2. 
	
	7. Use "Show Received File" to check for a new incoming file. It will be
	   saved to C:\data\dtn\in\ folder. Open native FileManager program to view the
	   contents of file using built-in applications. Files can be sent by "dtnsend"
	   utility of DTN2 package, provided a mail header is prepended.
	   
	NOTE: To determine bluetooth device MAC address of the phone, use "Info" menu
		  command "Bluetooth Address". Bluetooth must be activated prior to that.


	(We are aware that this does not yet win a usability price but it is really 
 	 intended for demonstration purposes only at this point. :-)



ROUTING FILE STRUCTURE:
-----------------------

	*** Routing file must have the name "routes.txt". At the moment it doesn't support
		any comments.
	
	*** Here are some example routing records (each terminated by ';'):
	
		(EID)				(Transport Type) (PRIORITY)		(Node-Addr)		(Node socket/channel)
		dtn://9500.dtn/1     tcp 			  1 			192.168.1.101 	5050 ;
		
		dtn://9300.dtn/1     rf_comm 			1 			0123456789AB 	14 ;

	*** IP-networks are supported using TCP only.
	
	*** Bluetooth only uses basic SSP profile. It's can use any channel number between 1-30.
		Bluetooth MAC address is provided in the form of 12-hex digits.


CONFIG FILE STRUCTURE:
----------------------

	*** Entries are in Field-Value-tuples format, terminated by a ';'. Field and values are 
		separated by '=' sign. No comments are supported at the moments.
	
	*** Examples are:
		
		local_eid=dtn://emulator.dtn/1;
		report_to_eid=dtn://emulator.dtn/1;
		tcp_listening_port=5050;
		bt_listening_channel=14;
