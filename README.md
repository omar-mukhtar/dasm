DTN Bundle Protocol implementation for Symbian OS

This is a very old implementation of Bundle Protocol (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5050).

Although Symbian is an obsolete platform, yet this legacy code can be useful for someone researching in DTN for following reasons:

- It defines architecture for reference impelmentation of Bundle Protocol.
- This code can be converted to a pure C++ implementation with moderate effort.
- Gernally describes good software development practices and OOP.

The work was carreid out as part of my masters thesis at Helsinki University of Technology (now Alto University) under kind supervision of Prof. Joerg Ott.
